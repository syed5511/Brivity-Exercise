      title: "Single and Double Quotes in JavaScript Strings!",
      body: "Strings in JavaScript are contained within a pair of either single quotation marks '' or double quotation marks \"\". Both quotes represent Strings but be sure to choose one and STICK WITH IT. If you start with a single quote, you need to end with a single quote. There are pros and cons to using both IE single quotes tend to make it easier to write HTML within Javascript as you donâ€™t have to escape the line with a double quote.\n",
